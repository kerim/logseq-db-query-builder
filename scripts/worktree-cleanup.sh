# worktree-cleanup.sh — Safe, idempotent superdev worktree/branch/notes cleanup
#
# Classifies the current state of a `.claude/worktrees/<slug>` worktree (plus
# its `superdev/<slug>` branch and `.claude/superdev/<slug>` run notes) and takes
# the one action that state allows — or refuses and explains why.
#
# NOTE: this script performs destructive filesystem operations under
# .claude/worktrees/<slug> and .claude/superdev/<slug>. When invoked from
# Claude Code, it MUST be run with the sandbox disabled
# (dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true) — the sandboxed Bash filesystem-write
# allowlist only covers pre-known paths, so a delete under an arbitrary
# <slug> here can die with "Operation not permitted" mid-delete, which is
# the exact failure mode this script exists to make recoverable from. Do
# not try to work around that error some other way — just disable the
# sandbox for this one invocation. Read-only/--dry-run invocations do not
# need the sandbox disabled.
#
# Usage: scripts/worktree-cleanup.sh --slug <slug> --base <branch> [--repo <path>] [--dry-run] [-h|--help]
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = success (no-op, plain removal, or auto-recovered)
#   2 = usage error (missing/bad args)
#   3 = refuse: genuine uncommitted changes present
#   4 = refuse: branch not merged into base
#   5 = ambiguous leftover artifact, needs a human decision
#   6 = unexpected failure during a mutating command (e.g. git worktree
#       remove/prune or rm -rf itself failed) — state may have changed;
#       re-run this script with the same --slug/--base to detect and
#       recover/report whatever resulted

worktree-cleanup.sh — Safe, idempotent superdev worktree/branch/notes cleanup

Usage:
  scripts/worktree-cleanup.sh --slug <slug> --base <branch> [--repo <path>] [--dry-run]
  scripts/worktree-cleanup.sh -h | --help

Options:
  --slug <slug>   (required) the worktree/branch slug.
  --base <branch> (optional, default: main) the branch to check "merged" against.
  --repo <path>   (optional, default: computed project root) the main repo
                  root — NOT the worktree itself. This script is meant to be
                  run from the main checkout, operating on
                  <repo>/.claude/worktrees/<slug>.
  --dry-run       Run all read-only classification, print the state detected
                  and exactly what action would be taken and what message
                  would be shown, but perform zero filesystem/git mutations.
                  Exit code matches what the real run would produce.
  -h, --help      Show this help and exit 0.

Exit codes:
  0 = success (no-op, plain removal, or auto-recovered)
  2 = usage error (missing/bad args)
  3 = refuse: genuine uncommitted changes present
  4 = refuse: branch not merged into base
  5 = ambiguous leftover artifact, needs a human decision
  6 = unexpected failure during a mutating command — state may have changed;
      re-run with the same --slug/--base to detect and recover/report it

IMPORTANT — sandbox note:
  This script performs destructive filesystem operations under
  .claude/worktrees/<slug> and .claude/superdev/<slug>. When invoked from
  Claude Code, it MUST be run with the sandbox disabled
  (dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true) — the sandboxed Bash filesystem-write
  allowlist only covers pre-known paths, so a delete under an arbitrary
  <slug> here can die with "Operation not permitted" mid-delete, which is
  the exact failure mode this script exists to make recoverable from. Do
  not try to work around that error some other way — just disable the
  sandbox for this one invocation. Read-only/--dry-run invocations do not
  need the sandbox disabled.

# fallback this script's usage docs assume (`superdev/<slug>`), and the native
# EnterWorktree tool, which prefixes the branch with `worktree-` and flattens
# any `/` in the requested name to `+` (an EnterWorktree name of
# "superdev/foo" ends up as branch "worktree-superdev+foo", worktree dir
# ".claude/worktrees/superdev+foo" — so here `slug` is already "superdev+foo",
# and "worktree-$slug" is the correct guess). Guessing wrong here previously
# caused this script to refuse a fully-merged worktree with "branch not
# merged" because it was checking a branch name that didn't exist at all.
